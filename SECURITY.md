- **zkSTARKs** for scalable proof verification
- **Commitment schemes** for data hiding
- **Range proofs** for value privacy

### Multi-Layer Security
- **MEV Protection** with commit-reveal schemes
- **Oracle Manipulation** defense via Meta-Oracle Selector
- **Bridge Attack** prevention through Chain-of-Origin Guard
- **Fraud Detection** using AI-powered algorithms

### Smart Contract Security
- **Formal Verification** for critical contracts
- **Audit Trail** for all operations
- **Emergency Protocols** for incident response
- **Circuit Breakers** for automatic protection

## üö® **Reporting Security Vulnerabilities**

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues via:

- **Email**: sandeep.savethem2@gmail.com

| **Medium** | $1,000 - $5,000 | Information disclosure, DoS |
| **Low** | $100 - $1,000 | Minor security issues |

### Rules
- **No Social Engineering**: Do not target RTF team members
- **No DoS Attacks**: Do not disrupt services
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Follow proper reporting procedures
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure all testing is legal
- **One Reward Per Issue**: Duplicates receive reduced rewards
